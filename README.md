# romanIntConversions
C++ version compiles with g++ 4.2.1, Java version with Java 8 JDK.  Both programs accept either integer or roman numeral input, 
converting the value to the other format for output.  Admittedly not a task one needs to do often these days, maybe during 
superbowl season. But this program once helped me land a job, including here for good luck.
